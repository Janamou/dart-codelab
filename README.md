# Notes Application Code Lab

The goal of this code lab is to create note-taking application in **Dart**. We create simple application which can add notes, delete selected note or all notes in the list and we also try local storage to save the notes into the browser.

You will learn:
* how to write applications in Dart
* how to work with DOM manipulation in Dart
* how to work with JSON
* how to save data to local storage
* how to compile the application into the JavaScript
